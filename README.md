Stil working out the know-how of a blog building. For now, please follow chronological order. Thanks :)

1. The moment - 11.11.2022

I came across this idea or a concept of a "**Transcendental moment**" watching a socialistic POV podcast on capitalism, where it was an image of Lenin standing in a room full of, I presume, revolutionists during the russian revolution, all while listening to the revolt against the bourgeoisee.

At any given point of time in history, a great change, a monumental shift, happened because of an accumulation of tiny recurrences leading to that point (Popularly referred to as the butterfly effect). A catalyst or a person, in case of a revolution recognize this change or is an unconscious victim to the old paradigm who believe with all their heart that a new system is needed. That person is given complete control of the new system by the people since it is uncharted territory that they are stepping into and he/she seem to have better knowledge about it, however limited that is at that point. 

I believe that an individual's future, is of a very similar effect. Except the person in control is you. The small things that happen every single day at your work, house, or life in general seem slightly, very slightly, disturbing. Ignoring them day after day or making "adjustments" is the way we go by it normally. But when that moment comes, the moment a major change has to happen, we often have a choice, 

- [ ] Take action
- [ ] Adjust

And we often tend to choose the latter. Think about all those times you settled, think about all those times you told yourself it is more important to be happy and watch a movie, go out with friends or play a game, none of which you probably remember, because you gave into instant gratification. Think what could have been, if you took action.

Terrifying? Good. It is not too late. Instead of lazing off the next time the world brings you an opportunity, act on it. 

Hopefully this acts as a catalyst for your tomorrow :)
